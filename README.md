# GithubProfileFinder
Simple Github Profile Finder used to find user's information of: -user name, -repository, -following contacts and -url of the 
github page. just by inserting their user name in the search field. I used html, css and javascript to make it. It ll fetch 
data from github api and it will provide us with them when a user inserted the user-name and pressed the search button. 
It is very basic app, done during the time we learned how to fetch data and make applications like weather app. 
It needs to be improved.
